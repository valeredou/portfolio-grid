    "presentation": "The website presented here is e-survey. It is a platform (available in multiple languages) for automated online survey deployment. With an elegant showcase site, an intuitive creation module, and automated response management, e-survey makes the process fast and accessible.<br /> The main goal of the platform is to simplify online survey creation through a streamlined interface, designed in close collaboration with industry professionals.",
    "technique": "On the project from the initial sketches, I had the opportunity to have a great deal of freedom in making technological choices. My mission was to manage the front-end part of the platform, whether it was the questionnaire or response creation module.<br /> The choice of React was made quickly and unequivocally, as its component-based thinking and organization aligned perfectly with the project.<br /> Subsequently, other challenges arose, requiring us to implement more advanced state management, including Mobx.<br /> Towards the end of the project, I also worked on the back-end to optimize the performance of certain resource-intensive actions."
